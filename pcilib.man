.SH NAME
pcilib \- a library for accessing PCI devices

.SH DESCRIPTION

The PCI library (also known as \fIpcilib\fP and \fIlibpci\fP) is a portable library
for accessing PCI devices and their configuration space.

.SH ACCESS METHODS

.PP
The library supports a variety of methods to access the configuration space
on different operating systems. By default, the first matching method in this
list is used, but you can specify override the decision (see the \fB-A\fP switch
of \fIlspci\fP).

.TP
.B linux-sysfs
The
.B /sys
filesystem on Linux 2.6 and newer. The standard header of the config space is available
to all users, the rest only to root. Supports extended configuration space, PCI domains,
VPD (from Linux 2.6.26), physical slots (also since Linux 2.6.26) and information on attached
kernel drivers.
.TP
.B linux-proc
The
.B /proc/bus/pci
interface supported by Linux 2.1 and newer. The standard header of the config space is available
to all users, the rest only to root.
.TP
.B intel-conf1
Direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 1. Available on i386 and compatibles
on Linux, Solaris/x86, GNU Hurd, Windows, BeOS and Haiku. Requires root privileges.
.TP
.B intel-conf2
Direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 2. Available on i386 and compatibles
on Linux, Solaris/x86, GNU Hurd, Windows, BeOS and Haiku. Requires root privileges. Warning: This method
is able to address only the first 16 devices on any bus and it seems to be very
unreliable in many cases.
.TP
.B fbsd-device
The
.B /dev/pci
device on FreeBSD. Requires root privileges.
.TP
.B aix-device
Access method used on AIX. Requires root privileges.
.TP
.B nbsd-libpci
The
.B /dev/pci0
device on NetBSD accessed using the local libpci library.
.TP
.B obsd-device
The
.B /dev/pci
device on OpenBSD. Requires root privileges.
.TP
.B dump
Read the contents of configuration registers from a file specified in the
.B dump.name
parameter. The format corresponds to the output of \fIlspci\fP \fB-x\fP.
.TP
.B darwin
Access method used on Mac OS X / Darwin. Must be run as root and the system
must have been booted with debug=0x144.
.TP
.B win32-cfgmgr32
Device listing on Windows systems using the Windows Configuration Manager
via cfgmgr32.dll system library. This method does not require any special
Administrator rights or privileges. Configuration Manager provides only basic
information about devices, assigned resources and device tree structure. There
is no access to the PCI configuration space but libpci provides read-only
virtual emulation based on information from Configuration Manager. Starting
with Windows 8 (NT 6.2) it is not possible to retrieve resources from 32-bit
application or library on 64-bit system.
.TP
.B win32-sysdbg
Access to the PCI configuration space via NT SysDbg interface on Windows
systems. Process needs to have Debug privilege, which local Administrators
have by default. Not available on 64-bit systems and neither on recent 32-bit
systems. Only devices from the first domain are accessible and only first
256 bytes of the PCI configuration space is accessible via this method.
.TP
.B win32-kldbg
Access to the PCI configuration space via Kernel Local Debugging Driver
kldbgdrv.sys. This driver is not part of the Windows system but is part of
the Microsoft WinDbg tool. It is required to have kldbgdrv.sys driver installed
in the system32 directory or to have windbg.exe or kd.exe binary in PATH.
kldbgdrv.sys driver has some restrictions. Process needs to have Debug privilege
and Windows system has to be booted with Debugging option. Debugging option can
be enabled by calling (takes effect after next boot):
.B bcdedit /debug on

.SH PARAMETERS

.PP
The library is controlled by several parameters. They should have sensible default
values, but in case you want to do something unusual (or even something weird),
you can override them (see the \fB-O\fP switch of \fIlspci\fP).

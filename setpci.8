.SH NAME
lspci \- configure PCI devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B setpci
.RB [ options ]
.B devices
.BR operations ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B setpci
is a utility for querying and configuring PCI devices. It requires Linux kernel 2.1.82
or newer as it uses the /proc/bus/pci interface.
.PP
All numbers are entered in hexadecimal notation.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -v
Tells
.I setpci
to be verbose and display detailed information about configuration space accesses.
.TP
.B -f
Tells
.I lspci
not to complain when there's nothing to do (when no devices are selected).
This option is intended for use in widely-distributed configuration scripts
where it's uncertain whether the device in question is present in the machine
or not.
.TP
.B -D
`Demo mode' -- simulate configuration space accesses instead of really doing them.
It's useful to try
.B setpci -vD
to see what your complex sequence of
.B setpci
operations does before you actually execute it.

.SH DEVICE SELECTION
.PP
Before each sequence of operations you need to select which devices you wish that
operation to affect.
.TP
.B -s [[<bus>]:][<slot>][.[<func>]]
Select devices in specified bus, slot and function. Each component of the device
address can be omitted or set as "*" meaning "any value". All numbers are
hexadecimal.  E.g., "0:" means all devices on bus 0, "0" means all functions of device 0
on any bus, "0.3" selects third function of device 0 on all busses and ".4" selects only
fourth function of each device.
.TP
.B -d [<vendor>]:[<device>]
Select devices with specified vendor and device ID. Both ID's are given in
hexadecimal and may be omitted or given as "*" meaning "any value".

.SH OPERATIONS
.PP
To query value of a configuration register, just name it (either by typing its name or
by typing register address with optional
.BR .B ,
.B .W
or
.B .L
suffix specifying register width as byte, word or longword).
.PP
To set a register, write
.BR reg = values
where
.B reg
is the same you would use to query the register and
.B values
is a comma-separated list of values you want to write starting with the given
address.

.SH REGISTER NAMES
.PP
.B setpci
knows the following configuration register names. See PCI bus specs for their precise
meaning or consult
.B /usr/include/linux/pci.h
for few comments.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
`setpci -d *:* latency_timer=40' sets the latency timer to 64 (40 hexadecimal).
.PP
`setpci -s 0 device_id vendor_id' lists ID's of devices in slot 0 in all busses.
.PP
`setpci -s 12:3.4 34.l=1,2,3' writes longword 1 to register 34, 2 to register 35
and 3 to register 35 of device at bus 12, slot 3, function 4.
